Saw interesting research about "reading minds" from [Cell.com](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00681-6). It was actually about using AI with brain sensors (surgery required) to read "inner speech".

Wonderful that it is enough to decode ~25-50% of simple wording, but not enought for understanding sentences with context. But still, once some xiaomi-mi-band-like device for passive brain scan will be released I definitelly get one.

Or maybe I should try some open-source brain-computer-interaction DIY device...
