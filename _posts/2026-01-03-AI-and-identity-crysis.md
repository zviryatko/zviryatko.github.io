Talking to someone smarter or more succesfull can inspire, or despire, depends on context. For example when you tried hard in studing or gym, or whenever, but someone else got the same out of nothing. Constantly it decrease motivation.

Touching something that makes your skills near pointless could lead to catastrophe in big scale. Chatbots already leads to depression, and I believe next years will be oriented on solving this issue.
