Yesterday tested new open source model by OpenAI with my local setup. Well, it was interesting experience. The model much better of anything I saw before, level of hallucinations was still incredible.

I think self running language models are far-far away from commercial ones. Maybe reason in hardware cost: local setup ~2-3k vs data center 20-40k only for A100-H200 nvidia gpuâ€¦

But I have hope to see better results for text-to-speech models, or some more specific, where results are more determined.
