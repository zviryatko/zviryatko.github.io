Recently Meta got caught (again) on chatbots that has romantic connections with kids. Not sure is it was romantic or sexual content. But I see no reason to worry about, since 95% of RPG games have many romantic dialogues, sometimes you can even have relationships with another npc, even sexual ones. And there many parents who jokingly trying to “marriage” their kids with friend’s kids.

And when you grown up “best” thing you can do is to look into internet to find the answers. Well, now we have chatbot who can even keep hot conversations with us.
