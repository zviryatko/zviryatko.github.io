Remember when AI slowly started integrating with most of our computer tools? Mostly online tools. When it first got access to the internet, to google search, to some form to submit. And somehow people thought that inevitable has come - full AI integration with all online services.

Surprise-surprise - that future didn't happen.

Instead, we becomes hostages of the situation: you see what is going on with web scrapping and AI? As temporary solution I heard proposal to add special output format for AI to make it life easier, instead of parsing your website HTML page, AI expects .md page format. Instead of parsing your online registration form it expect that your developers implements MCP format for allowing AI easily use your site.

It is complete roles changing. Now we going to serve to AI.
