Remember that period of time in IT jobs when for being hired you just need to join company with some minimal knowledge and the great will. Later requirements have grown and you need to learn something, later companies required more and more knowledge.

For example frontend trainee must know React well, components, states, css, js, with sdlc, git, agile and a lot of other things you never met in your first years of building dumb forms.

Now AI joins the cycle, Meta&co now forcing usage of AI just for being hired! Not AI for coding, but AI for effective self-management, ai for better writing, testing... Requirements have grown again, and we gonna eat that.
