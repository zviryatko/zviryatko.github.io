Recently good practice for code generated by AI was keeping the prompt in comments above the generated code parts. Looks like it is not an issue anymore - all the code is autogenerated. And the documentation. And tests. Should we still keep somewhere original prompts with all change requests?

Another question about autotests - let's say there some browser tests that automatically generated, in a while they must be updated due to change of view or other features. But should they generated based on specs, which generated based on "initial prompt" and all the comments?

So it looks like we need to back to SDD (spec driven development)? Or better to say "Generated Spec Driven Development".
