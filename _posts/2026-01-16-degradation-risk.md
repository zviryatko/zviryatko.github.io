Chatbots leads to degradation of thinking abilities, and it's not just a joke, but growing up number of researches over last year. I remember when peopl were concerned about using Wikipeadia leads to problems when you need to do some reasearch: go to library, read books, write down cites. Which is sounds totally useles now ofc.
My mom once said me that during her 8th level in school they got access to pens (literally ballpoint pens) and started to use it instead of quill (feather pen for writing), and teachers said: don't get used to it, this temporar trend will go away soon.

Well, they were right, every year less and less pens I see. Regarding GPT not even sure would it go to dramatic degradation or maybe it will be like switching between planning in head to planning on paper. For sure we will become lazier in some areas, but more effective in others.
