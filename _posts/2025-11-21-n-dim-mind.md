AI as creatures with multidimensional thinking should be better in navigating in 4D+ space. For humans it is hard to imagine 4D space, but we can navigate throug it with tricks like consecutive projection. But for the one who only can see multidimensional matrix, it should be much easier to navigate around it, and see some patterns.

Even if it sounds more like Lem's story about robots, I truly believe that such "tool" can help humanity in exploring surrounding world.
