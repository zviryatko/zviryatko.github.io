Some options I see for myself:

 - Keep working as a consultant. Free time use for involving into AI.
 - Keep consulting and free time use to build own SaaS.
 - Switch to CTO role.
 - Join another service/product company on higher salary/position.
 - Join another service/product company on better stack (AI).
