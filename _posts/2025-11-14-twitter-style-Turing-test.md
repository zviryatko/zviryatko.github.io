Reading stories on LinkedIn I've found that some of them have really familiar styling, abd sometimes topic. Suspiciously familiar. Answering on one of it I found myself being caught into info-spammers: AI generated content. Like those heartbreaking stories in instagram.

Wondering why Turing made his popular test as one where two persons should chat, and not just Radio (or any social media; broadcasts). How long agonwe crossed that line where we can't distinguish human or bot, that wrote the post?
