Now we need to talk seriously - self-conscious life is a REAL risk that can happen. No one can tell us that it can't, nor opposite. So we need to prepare. Or at least build some actions in case if (or when) that happen.

What actually I'm proposing:
 - define clear, strict standards, the base line, what we can count as self-conscious life, the one that deserves it's existing;
 - define our actions, what we should and especially should not do for that kind of creature;
 - decide on "minimum support plan", since it can be artificial life, and according to Saint-Exupéry: we are responsible;

Another option will be to finally listen to world scientists and decline any tries to build artificial life. Or, as Pope said: kill embryo before 14th day, until it got own soul.
