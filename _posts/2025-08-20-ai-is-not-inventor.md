Found interesting thing: if AI helps you to automate huge part of your work, then, well, I have bad news for you - you aren’t involved in anything new. Most of it maybe routine.

Where it not good yet is about inventing new approaches. AI can perfectly mix most of known ways to solve problems, but it can’t invent new. Yet.
