title: "When AI replace developers?"

TLDR: not before fully self-driving cars replace manual ones. And it's not question of quality, but trust and responsibilities. Important thing is that AI can't fully complete, nor fully understand problem, so developers still needed to program and verify solution completed by AI. Like self-driving car can't get your McDrive order (yet, but cool startup idea).

Tbh, while world slowly switching from agile teams to AI-commandos, but the next step - non-human-AI-developer, most likely won't be used anywhere except early startups or small business who can't afford to hire real one.
