Just a small real-life example - I need to analyze my tasks activities based on github + jira + office 365 emails. And unless I export everything manually (which is not possible in case of office365) it's not even possible.

Hear me out: you can not type to copilot/chatgpt/claude/gemini something like "hey, what did I work on most of August?". Why not? Because there are not enought bridges built.

Chatgpt only got integration with gmail (or gemini, whatever), and if your personal mail is kinda mixed with work mailbox, it breaks the context. For outlook, or maybe some proton, slack, teams, whatever, there no integration. Even when it will be, there stil will be 100500 other services that out of context: figma, aws, google meets... So AI now is like secretary that doesn't know how to create event anywhere except google calendar.
