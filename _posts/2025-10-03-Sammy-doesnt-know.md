Recently Sam said about chatgpt becomes smarter and give more professional advices to people. And somehow he trully believes that people follows that advices... Again, problem of theoretical possibilities meets the real world. Only few people follow advices. And only few of them follows it right way, not their own way.

It doesn't matter how smart AI is. Because bottlenecks are the same - people. People can't learn fast, they can't adopt fast. And AI barely can change that.

Sammy doesn't know. So don't say Sammy.
