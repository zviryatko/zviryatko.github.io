Seeing a lot of tutorials on how to use AI for coding and many of them looks like "write next promp to one ai chat, copy out put and paste to another ai chat, copy and paste it to the third one..." and it reminds me funny period in 2005-2009 when most of coding tutorials was like "download that jquery library to your project and change next lines inside it...".

Now I know it was dirty trick to run things at least somehow. And now it is red flag for development. So, I feels like we are trying to build next gen development based on dirty tricks no one will appreciate in future.
