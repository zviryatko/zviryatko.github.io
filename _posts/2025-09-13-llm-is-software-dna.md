What is main function of DNA? Store, transform and use information for building other complex functions. So technically if your technology able to reproduce itself or other more complex things it is becoming a basic building block.

The size and performance of LLMs now doesn't look like it is a foundamenta block, but let's imagine it can be squized to much smaller size - we can use "simplified english" with 10% of the words, and focus SML (small LM) mostly on code generating task with very simple language with less keywords. It can be JS, C, Go or even Brainfuck, which is Turing-complete, so allows building everything.

Could such SLM be able to generate code for larger LLMs, or for not relevants tasks, like CV? If so, well, we built a DNA.
