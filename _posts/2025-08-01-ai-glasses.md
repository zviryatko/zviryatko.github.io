Mark said that he’s sure in the future anyone who doesn’t use AI glasses won’t have any learning or work advantages compared to those who wear them.

I think that’s BS. Glasses with AI don’t bring real benefits. For example, inventing the pen, microphone, video camera, or even telephone gave people fundamentally new ways to make money. The same applies to LLMs.

Making a phone mobile, or adding a camera to smartphones didn’t bring that level of change. Only when digital cameras became popular through the internet did they become impactful. Offline digital cameras made little sense.

AI glasses won’t win the battle with smartphones. A real game-changing device would offer something new — like a 24/7 AI agent that watches you, corrects your behavior: stops you from buying sugar snacks, being late, forgetting milk. 

Phones could do it, but a wearable AI with constant camera/mic access would understand better. If this creates a market for personal AI assistants, it would be a revolution.
