Mark said that he is sure in future anyone who won’t use their AI glasses won’t have any benefits in learning and work compared to ones who wear.

I think that’s BS, cause glasses with AI doesn’t bring any benefits, for example: inventing pen, microphone, video camera or even telephone gives a huge boost because people who use it had conceptually new way of making money. The same with inventing of LLMs.

Making phone mobile instead of wired doesn’t give so much level of benefits. Adding camera to smartphone also not giving such benefits in comparison to old digital cameras. Making cameras digital given the boost only with the popularity of internet connection. 'Cause offline digital camera makes no sense.

So I really think AI glasses won’t win battle with smartphones. Instead, if I created a game changer device, I’d chosen something that gives opportunities to create something new that wasn’t created before.

It could be instant 24/7 “spying” AI agent that always knows what you are doing and can correct your behaviour: prevent you buying alcohol, sugar snacks, late to work, forgetting to buy the milk. Despite that’s kinda possible with phone, wearable AI agent with access to camera, mic will know the context better. 

If this could create new market for selling AI assistants, it will be a Revolution.
