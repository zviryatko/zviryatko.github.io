Some time ago it was everything in one app. Later due to data growth databases moved to separate service. Later other services were separated: email, auth, search, caching, and even UI. And now we need ML model as required service for every app we’re building.

The closes example is camera on mobile phone.  Can’t imagine any new app without AI integration. Probably it will be cloud api, or some small local hosted models, but its new reality, accept that and start building.
