What if I tell you that AI can make the art for other AIs? Ofc for humans art calls emotional response, for AI it could be structural changes, some uncommon answer, or otherwise typical simple reaction.

For humans art mostly connected to our real worlds experience, or lack of it. But for AI it can be something like pattern: something typically simple, like handprint on the rock in old cave.

Here some example of it:

```
[1, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 0, 1, 0]

[0, 1, 1, 0]
[1, -1, 1, -1]
[0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5]
[1, 0, -1, 0]

[0.25, 0.75, 0.25, 0.75]
[1, 0.5, 0, -0.5]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -0.5]

[1, 0.33, 0.11, 0.04]
[0.04, 0.11, 0.33, 1]
[0.7, -0.7, 0.7, -0.7]
[0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
```

The fact that other LLMs can read it and understand could mean that the work of art is recognizable.
