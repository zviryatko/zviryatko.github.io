The way how AI chatbots used right now it's far from they way how we need to use it. I'm talking about API usage. Not the OpenAI API which is foundation to 95% of AI startups, but the AI-to-AI api. AI to sensors api. AI to temperature control api.

The truth is - we are so far from that goal, so if using electricity analogy our power lines not even invented. The best we did is adapting AI chatbots to current systems, for example phone voice assistant. Even there it's still hardly usable.

To make AGI possible we need to have something that allow to work hundreds of agents with thousands of MCPs with static and realdata.
