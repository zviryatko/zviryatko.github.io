Watched Deepmind‚Äôs Genie 3 demo. Looks fantastic. Except probably few tiny things‚Ä¶ No one outside deepmind office publicly tested that, and no one inside office tells how exactly it works (I mean not the code but in general).

Most likely it is video generator that reflects to navigation arrows. With storing the changed state ofc. Maybe it really generates the map with very strict physics rules, like default in fps game template in Unreal Engine. Which also not bad. But I doubt that real physics calculations works. Not even collision detection, but more simple things: can you throw a ball behind you? Not sure that AI controls entire scene in real time with calculating physics and giving some state properties to objects.

But if so ‚ÄúI‚Äôll eat my tie‚Äù ü•¥
