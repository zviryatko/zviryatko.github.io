I was thinking about tools that check if text was generated by AI — for LinkedIn messages, technical documentation, lawyers' requests. Since no one likes text that makes no sense and wasn’t done by a person. 

But what about code?

Do we like the code generated by AI, or will we soon need an AI-code-detector in GitHub PRs?
