I was thinking about a tool that checks if text was generated by AI, for LinkedIn messages, technical documentation, lawyer's requests. No one likes a text that makes no sense since done not by person itself. But whatâ€™s about the code? Do we like the code generated by AI, or soon we need ai-code-detector in GitHub PRs?
