If you have indie games studio it’s probably star time for you. Many AI tools could help cover most aspects of game dev that hardly possible to do alone.

Story telling? Easy, literally any LLM. Graphical models? Pfff, here bunch of free assets, use AI plugin for Blender to adjust. Localisation? Ha, some LLMs has much more languages that most ever heard. Voice actors? Don’t even need to call elevenlabs, use open source models.

It doesn’t even cost you money. Only time. Also, it could help with marketing. I need to try making diablo-like game.
