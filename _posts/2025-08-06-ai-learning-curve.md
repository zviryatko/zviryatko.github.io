Watching famous video by Andrej Karpathy https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0, I got another insight: AI things isn’t that as hard as most developers scared about.

It looks hard because it has some Math in it, and because it is new, and of course because of Math again. But if I’d need to explain most of web development rules and principles, or business issues let’s say, I think it’ll scare most of nowadays AI engineers.
