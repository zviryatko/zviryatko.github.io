Like with self driving cars everyone expected linear progress between first Tesla with letâ€™s say advanced cruise control and self parking to fully self driving cars. For detecting progress function we need to understand what is 100% done for self driving, but no one knows it.

Exactly the same situation with AI - there is no 100%, no one knows what must be developed each year to show x2 progress compared to previous year. Or even 10% progress. It is not store checklist where you know exactly whole list and can track the progress.
