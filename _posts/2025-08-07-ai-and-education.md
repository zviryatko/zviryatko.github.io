Let's do one experiment: try to learn some shirt science topic that you never understand (or you think you’d never understand) with the help of ChatGPT. For example Math.
Try repeate this experiment with your partner.

Anyone who at least tried to use reasoning in LLMs, probably, already knows the results. Imagine how cool it could be in your childhood to have such a kind, nice, always supporting and patient teacher that have infinite time to explain you any concept, theorem, damn questions like “why sky is blue and not green”.

Minecraft can’t even dream about that effect on school education. We must already change schools tasks to target on self learning. And grade also must focus on explicit 90% of chatbot learning and collaboration. Teachers in that case must correct the direction and score the results.
