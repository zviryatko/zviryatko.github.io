According to scientists Life is reproducible system that can evolve. And we have a lot of self-copying systems, simple PC virus, that sneaks, hides from firewalls and self reproduce on the other machines, but it can't evolve.

Imagine we give it built-in LLM, or make virus that can use OS provided LLM, to evolve, to rewrite its code for spreading more efficiently.

So, technically it can be called an artificial life. Should we built it?
