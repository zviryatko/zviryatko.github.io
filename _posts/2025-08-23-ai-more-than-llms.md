Despite most people think that AI is chatbots and chatbots is the only AI, it is far from truth. Chatbot is interface like web-site you see now, also there other interfaces like api, messengers.

It is important to remember that AI is algorythms. Algorythms for wide tasks, starting from OCR and CV, weather forecast (or literaly any sequensual data forecast), to detecting patterns in any data where patterns potentially exists (except bitcoin price ofc).

The one I believe most important is physics and chemistry (including biology). Analyzing patterns in atomic structure of various elements it can predict it's properties for example for new batteries usage. Gathering data how genomes are built will help to get rid of many diseases or even once build artificial chemical life.
