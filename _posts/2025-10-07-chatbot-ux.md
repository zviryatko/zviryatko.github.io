Got new feature on Outlook working account - Copilot. The first phrase I put into it: "Delete all emails with Broadcast message or from Github/Azure or any code related update", and what I got? Damn instructions on how to do that by myself.

Microsoft - you're doing it wrong! I don't wont instruction, I want job done.
