For some period of time humanity thinking that there was only one thing that they invented and not just steal from nature - zip lock. Until one morning some other scientist found exactly same zip locks on grasshopper's knees.

It should not minify the impact of humanity to invent something that beautiful even if it exists somewhere else.

Even if LLMs weren't invented, but mostly incidentally happened, they still result of humans actions. Quite impressive result.

But I'm wondering - are there any nature origin examples of such ML techniques that leads to reasonable thinking, except of all living organisms of course?
