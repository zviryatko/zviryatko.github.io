These days gamers and game stores trying to separate AI generated content from human generated. And that's quite clear why - quantity over quality problem. But should we totally refuse AI content in games, or just use it where it generates better value?

Recently game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 got it's ukrainian translation, which is cool, that's another argument for me to find time for play. But it got only text translation, not the voice one. For sure because of complexity of voicing for open world games with tons of stories.

But as a gamer I'm totally ok to have not perfect machine voiced localization. Maybe as experimental feature. Maybe only if publisher approves it's quality. Or at least for indie games where no budget for even english real voice actors.

I believe AI-policy rules should be improved, at least to split trash-generated content and additional features that can't be provided.
