You know what would be cool? To have MCP as option to all working tools: jira, figma, slack, mail, github... linkedin. You may say: stop, but there is an API. MCP != API it is API for AI only usecases. Let me explain.

When you calling API you operating by objects and it's states (in case of REST). Or actions for RCP, which actually changes state, but it still about objects and state. Now imagine MCP as extension for chatbots, for example, I want chatbot to fetch design from Figma, in correct format gives it to Png2Html chatbot and generate component on my project. We need AI-extending-like API, not REST.
