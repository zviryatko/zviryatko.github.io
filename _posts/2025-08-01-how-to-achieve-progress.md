The progress achieving line is look like parabolic line - to achieve desired goal you must work twice
harder than expected. 

 - for good English 1-2 lessons a week is not enough, for visible progress it must be 4-5 or even 7.
 - for fit body the same, gym every day to see progress; eat more healthy than you imagined you should.
 - work triple time more than it sounds reasonable to get what you desire.
