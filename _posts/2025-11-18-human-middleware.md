Since GPT came to this world abd start coding, one thing makes me nervous - where to put junior developers? And now I think I have idea where.

Recently I got experience in hiring junior dev for personal non commercial project. The job he can do actually perfectly match space between the smartest tool humanity ever create and simple thing like fixing github pipeline that you literally need to open right page, find concrete error message, google it, copy-past the code, run and repeat until done.

The thing is - spending time on integrating AI with complex tools doesn't worth the effort, but simply connecting them manually is effective. So I believe "trainee vibe-coder" is really what we all need.
