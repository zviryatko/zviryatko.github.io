Qualia - a new word I learned today from GPT. Chatbot is pretty sure it can't "feel", because even we can't decide how it's to feel. We can't define it because still arguing about different philosophical questions. And not we're not even can't define what is it to be "real", but also can't define what will be to be "real" for artificial life. And what should be the difference between being real artificially or by nature.

It can't feel because feelings comes from subjective inside, and can't be observed objectively. According to some philosophical schools, but some others have believes in opposite. Of course we can't say something like "oh, this robots is on 80% a new self-aware life form", nor the opposite.

Most likely we won't be able even agree on preventing inhuman experiments on almost-self-aware robots. Except probably case of shame for google's hockey with Atlas robot. So, we might have a chance to stay humans.
