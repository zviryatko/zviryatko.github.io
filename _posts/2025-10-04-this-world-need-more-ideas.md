MCP basically re-invented the API. And it must open wide range of opportunities, connection of everything with everything. But in reality what I see is many opensource projects struggling adding examples of MCP to their apps, which actually doing nothing useful. Like /mcp for current time.

It reminds me few years ago chatbots era, everyone added chatbots for everything, but in reality only few of them are useful. And mostly very specific like gif-/meme-generators in slack. So we may stuck with real-world usage of mcp.
