AI agents are at only ~10% of their potential. Why? Because they don’t run in a `while(true)` loop.

Right now they’re like phones — you turn them on, get a result, then they stop. True power will come when they work continuously.

Not just one agent — but multiple:

- diet agent  
- meditation agent  
- work messaging agent  
- main coordinator agent  

They should talk to other people’s agents — for example, to schedule meetings.

I’m waiting for such agents on my phone.
