As I said before, AI agents are only on their 10% power right now, because they still don’t have `while(true)` loop to run in.

This means for now they work as phone/tv/radio - you turn it on, get the result of work and then it turns off. The main true power of them will be available when they work continuously.

Not a single agent but a lot of agents:

 - diet agent
 - meditation agent
 - work messaging agent

...and some major main agent that coordinates them all. They should be able to “speak” with other people’s agents. For example for scheduling meetings.

I’m waiting for such on my phone.
