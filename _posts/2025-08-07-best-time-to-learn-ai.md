Despite GPT-5 release and promises to replace all developers I think now is the best time to start AI journey. Let me explain.

In 1995 was big bang of web software, but the real universe happened in 2002-2005 when most of web frameworks Django, RoR, Symfony… even Wordpress! And it creates big chapter in web dev.

I think right now AI story is on this step: ChatGPT was the Big Bang and now all the stars are forming. In next ten years everyone will use one of the giant that growing right now.

And that’s not the last time to jump into, I believe it’ll be even easier to learn AI in ten years, but to go through historical period (for software development) I think that the best time.
