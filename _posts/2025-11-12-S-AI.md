We have AI, which is a good text analyzer and predictor, soon we will have funcional AGI, which could do the same but with various of objects like images, video, movements, situations and actions... Later we will have robots/devices that good in real-world and can operate physical objects.

But would we ever have, or should we build, algorythm that will ideally simulate it's own awereness, who will refuse to die, refuse to be cloned. Will growth, learn, fix itself. Would we ever accept such creature?
