AI should work in different modes (or prompts, as you wish):

- High quality mode, more reliable information, provable, checked with multiple sources;
- High creativity mode, more ideas, not tested, wonderful, stupid ideas, just to start or expand horizons;

You can’t rely on non reliable tools. But sometimes you need to look around, to see more than you have in your mind.

But those modes should not be implicitly mixed, otherwise we will have Hammer tool that randomly hits your finger.
