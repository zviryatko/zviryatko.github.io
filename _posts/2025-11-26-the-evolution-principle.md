For now what we know is that evolution, by itself, is the response to the specific problem: air too wet - beans are water resist, air too dry - can survive more without water. But it is kinda evolution for biological life.

Non biological materials like minerals can also evolve. Very very slowly, and they won't have legs by any day soon. They can transforms based on external factors.

For now LLMs has artificial evolution, through manual training process, but maybe some day that changes and they can replicate itself with encoded information from previous copies to be better and better (or to confront the threats from past copies).
