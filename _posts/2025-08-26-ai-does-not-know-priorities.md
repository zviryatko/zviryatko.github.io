Remember few month ago one experimentator tried to start business [ruled by Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/research/project-vend-1)? Despite experiment sucefully failed, as, I believe, was expected, it opened up good discussion about edge cases and general rules for really complex tasks.

For sure it avoided the main concern that AI won't replace any time soon - goals & priorities. People still will be in a loop of decision making, prompting and executing the response. If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favorable.
